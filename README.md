1.	Introduction to the Project✍🏻


With the vast development of the technology, people are busy for their tasks. So, all are keen to use mobile applications. There are so many kinds of mobile applications. We can find many of them and cannot say that “Can we find any kind of mobile app ?.” 
In the real world, people find mobile applications for their day-today works. Most probably, the women search for the new food recipes for their breakfasts, lunch, and dinner also. “Kitchen Stories” is the most innovative mobile application for getting reliable recipes. There are so many user-friendly interfaces to get better UX. We are heard about many applications such as Hail, Yik Yak, and everpix are lacked with user-friendliness. Our team concern more and more to give a better UX by applying the Mobile Application Development Principles and Concepts. So, we hope to move on our project for success and we don’t fail. 
Actually, “Kitchen Stories” application is not a regular recipe application. It has so many subcomponents which are important to people. There are online food ordering experience, meeting with experts, and community support. Within one application, user can experience these services. User can explore various recipes and if he/she is interested in, he/she can order the food to the home as well. Not only that, if user know a recipe, then he/she can add it to the application through an interactive user interface. We promise to give a reliable data communication between the user and the database. Some actions related to the user; the application will be informed through notifications. And also, by cooperating with the database, the user also notifies from the alerts. 
Concerning about the payment and order management, we hope to implement a most accurate and reliable payment gateway for paying purposes. We plan to deliver orders to the doorsteps with an fair fee all around the country. So, users are not to worry about that. Actually, we provide a experts’ support related to the recipes and then user can discuss their problems with them. In addition to that, the user can hire them for their personal matters. Fortunately, we implement the component to register users who are talented with the skills and experiences. So, then they can also be experts and others can hire them. It is a great opportunity to earn extra money for the users given by the application which we are implemented. 
Moreover, our app has community support. User can rate the recipes and put feedbacks about our order and the delivery services. So, others can view the ratings according to their desired recipes and they can decide that “Do we experience those recipes; buy or reject?” At the end, our team think that we can build a better application to the world.
